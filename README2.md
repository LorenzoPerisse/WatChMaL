You need to move the following folders to the directory where the WatChMaL folder is located.
You can run the bash script /WatChMaL/folders_to_move/move_folders.sh or do it manually. 

```bash
bash /WatChMaL/folders_to_move/move_folders.sh
```

Your final directory structure should look like that:

|_index_lists
|_macro_launch
|_notebooks
|_sweep_run
|_WatChMaL
	|_analysis
	|_config
	|_watchmal
